## Command Line (AKA:)
  1. shell
  2. terminal

## Why do we use command line?
  1. not all programs have GUIs (GUIs are a lot of work to build)
  2. At one time, no computers had GUI - all UI was text
  3. Many dev tools are command line only
  4. We've been using GitHub Desktop, but `git` is much more powerful

## Recognizing shell commands
  1. prompt `bash $`

## Basic shell commands

  4. `$ mkdir`
  4. `$ rm` (DANGER ZONE)
